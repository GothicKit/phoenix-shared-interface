A C-library wrapping the [phoenix](https://github.com/lmichaelis/phoenix) library for parsing game assets of
[PiranhaBytes'](https://www.piranha-bytes.com/) early 2000's games [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game))
and [Gothic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_II). This library is intended to be used as a proxy to _phoenix_ in
cases where C++ can not be used (i.e. when interfacing with another programming language).
